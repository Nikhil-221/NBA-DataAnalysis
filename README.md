# NBA-DataAnalysis(1950-2022)

My Project shows you a quick analysis of 70+ years of NBA stats to see how the game has changed and evolved over the years.



# Libraries Used:-

pandas - Data analysis and manipulation.

numpy - Numerical computations

matplotlib and seaborn - Data visualization

plotly - Interactive plots and graphs




# What I Explored:- 

1) Height vs Rebounds - Do taller players really grab more boards?

2) Steph Curry Effect - Shows how he revolutionized the 3 point shot compared to league average

3) 3-Point Revolution - From barely used to everyone's favorite shot.

4) All-Time Scorers - Top scorers in the leagues history.

5) Scoring Over Time - How PPG changed through the years

6) Player Longevity - Who had the longest careers

7) Most Versatile - Players who were all rounders. (triple double maniacs xD) (points, rebounds, assists)



Check out my project to find out all the statistical data, because ball might lie, but stats dont üèÄ.
